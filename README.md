## Random Quote Machine

A React-based Random Quote Machine app that generates a random quote and displays it to the user. Users can fetch a new quote and share it on Twitter with a single click. This project is based on [freeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine](https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/) but with personalized styling and enhancements.

## Overview

This project is a web application that displays a randomly selected quote and its author. It also allows users to share the quote on Twitter. The app was built using React to fulfill a series of user stories and testing requirements from freeCodeCamp.
